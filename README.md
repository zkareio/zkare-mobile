## Project Description

Medical data management and analytics are crucial components of the healthcare system. In recent times, the advent of digital technologies has facilitated the collection, processing, and analysis of medical data. However, the potential of medical data is not fully realized due to concerns related to data privacy, security, and ownership. The centralized management of medical data also poses challenges related to interoperability, scalability, and accessibility.

In this context, ZKare is a decentralized platform that ensures secure and privacy-preserving medical data management and analytics. The platform is based on the concept of proof of trust, using the newest protocol, which enables users to control their data while allowing healthcare institutions to access and use the data for research and development.

The ZKare platform solves the interoperability challenge by providing a decentralized platform that enables healthcare providers to access patient data from multiple sources securely. Patients can choose to share their data with healthcare providers, researchers, and other stakeholders. In exchange, they can receive incentives, such as compensation or access to new treatments and therapies.

The platform also solves the data privacy and security challenges by using zero-knowledge proofs to ensure that patient data is protected from unauthorized access and misuse. Zero-knowledge proofs allow healthcare providers to access patient data without revealing any sensitive information, ensuring that patient privacy is preserved.

## Our Vision

We aim to revolutionize the healthcare ecosystem by rapidly bridging the huge deficit in data sharing. Medical researchers often face huge difficulties in procuring relevant patient records which lead to increased delay and costs of the projects. By incentivizing the patients to share their medical records in a truly anonymous manner using ZKare, medical researchers get access to crucial data promptly which would increase the innovations in the medical care industry exponentially and potentially save millions of lives at affordable rates.
